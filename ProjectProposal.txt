Team: Maggie Jakus and Logan Sweet 
Project: Advanced Encryption Standard

For our project, we will investigate and implement a system that uses advanced encryption standard. Our goals include not only using verilog to create it, but also get a better sense of the history and uses of the advanced encryption standard as well as other comparable alternatives. 

Deliverables:
1. A history and discussion in context of advanced encryption standard
2. Block diagrams showing the high-level operation 
3. A verilog implementation of advanced encryption standard
